## Review Process

When reviewing code:
1. First, understand the purpose of the changes
2. Check if the implementation aligns with the stated purpose
3. Look for potential bugs or edge cases
4. Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
5. Ensure consistency with the existing codebase

Remember: The goal is to improve code quality while being constructive and supportive.
