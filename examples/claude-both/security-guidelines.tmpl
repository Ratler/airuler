# Security Guidelines

## Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs at application boundaries
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize data before displaying to prevent XSS
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Sensitive Data Handling
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords to version control
- Use environment variables or secure configuration management
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement secure session management

## Dependencies and Libraries
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit for known vulnerabilities
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Follow principle of least privilege

## API Security
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak information

## Code Review Checklist
- Check for hardcoded credentials
- Verify input validation is present
- Ensure proper error handling
- Confirm secure communication protocols

When writing or reviewing code, always consider the security implications and follow these guidelines.
