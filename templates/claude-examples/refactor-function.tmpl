# Refactor Function

Refactor the function `$ARGUMENTS` with the following guidelines:

## Analysis Steps
1. **Identify Issues**: Look for code smells like:
   - Long parameter lists
   - Nested conditionals
   - Repeated code patterns
   - Poor variable naming
   - Complex logic that could be simplified

2. **Performance Considerations**: 
   - Optimize loops and data structures
   - Remove unnecessary operations
   - Consider caching for expensive calculations
   - Minimize memory allocations

3. **Readability Improvements**:
   - Extract complex logic into helper functions
   - Use descriptive variable names
   - Add comments for non-obvious logic
   - Simplify conditional statements

## Refactoring Process
1. Show the current function
2. Explain the issues you've identified
3. Provide the refactored version with explanations
4. Highlight the improvements made
5. Suggest any additional tests needed

## Code Quality Checks
- Ensure the refactored code maintains the same functionality
- Verify error handling is preserved or improved
- Check that the function signature remains compatible
- Confirm that performance is improved or at least not degraded

Please proceed with analyzing and refactoring the specified function.
